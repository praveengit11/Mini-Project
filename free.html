        <h2>1. NATURAL EFFECTS</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Renewable energy projects have also contributed in improving environmental impacts such as reduction of carbon dioxide
        gas, awakening community about the climate change. The study observed very small impacts on the people living in a
        particular area, tourism, cost of energy supply, and educational impacts. Significant impacts were observed in
        improvement of life standard, social bonds creation, and community development. They also observed that the renewable
        energy projects are complex to install and are local environmental and condition sensitive. Their forecasting,
        execution, and planning require more consideration and knowledge as compared to other projects. The two main aspects
        of environment are air and water pollution, normally created by the discharged water from houses, industries, and
        polluted rain, and discharge of used oils and liquids contains poisonous chemicals and heavy metals like mercury, lead,
        etc. Along with water pollution, natural resources can be maintained and greenhouse effect and air pollution can be
        mitigated by the proper usage of renewable energy sources as shown in below figure. Carbon dioxide emission with the
        generation of electric power using different energy resources is given in Figure 1.</p>

        <h2>2. TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS</h2>
        <p>One of the important assessing factors to generate power from renewable energy sources is the availability and their
        technical limitation. Each resource has some limitations; photovoltaic has limitation to generate power only because
        heat energy from sun can only be received during the day time, except cloudy season. For wind turbine, speed should not
        increase beyond 25 m/s; otherwise, turbine will be damaged. Also, low speed of wind,i.e, less than 3 m/s, will not be
            sufficient for the generation of electric power. Geothermal has good ability to generate power throughout the day
            for 24 h but is geography limited according to the presence of resources. Hydro-electric power plants are easy to
            start, stop, and operate within minutes; hence, they are considered as one of the highest available, reliable, and
            flexible renewable energy resources. From efficiency point of view, hydroelectric is classified at the top of the
            list, and then wind energy, photovoltaic, and geothermal are lowest efficient renewable energy resources. Because of
            availability of cells in different categories, the efficiency of photovoltaic is very much variable. According
            to efficiency, different energy sources are categorized in Table 2.</p>

            </p>
            <li class="a">Renewable energy won’t run out</li> <br>
            <p>Renewable energy technologies use resources straight from the environment to generate power. These energy sources
            include sunshine, wind, tides, and biomass, to name some of the more popular options. Renewable resources won’t run out,
            which cannot be said for many types of fossil fuels – as we use fossil fuel resources, they will be increasingly
            difficult to obtain, likely driving up both the cost and environmental impact of extraction.</p>
            <li class="b">Maintenance requirements are lower</li> <br>
            <p>In most cases, renewable energy technologies require less overall maintenance than generators that use traditional fuel
            sources. This is because generating technology like solar panels and wind turbines either have few or no moving parts
            and don’t rely on flammable, combustible fuel sources to operate. Fewer maintenance requirements translate to more time
            and money saved.</p>
            <li class="c">Renewables save money</li> <br>
            <p>Using renewable energy can help you save money long term. Not only will you save on maintenance costs, but on operating
            costs as well. When you’re using a technology that generates power from the sun, wind, steam, or natural processes, you
            don’t have to pay to refuel. The amount of money you will save using renewable energy can vary depending on a number of
            factors, including the technology itself. In most cases, transitioning to renewable energy means anywhere from hundreds
            to thousands of dollars in savings.</p>
            <li class="d">Renewable energy has numerous health and environmental benefits</li> <br>
            <p>Renewable energy generation sources emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air. This means a smaller
            carbon footprint and an overall positive impact on the natural environment. During the combustion process, fossil fuels
            emit high amounts of greenhouse gases, which have been proven to exacerbate the rise of global temperatures and
            frequency of extreme weather events. <br> <br>

            The use of fossil fuels not only emits greenhouse gases but other harmful pollutants as well that lead to respiratory
            and cardiac health issues. With renewable energy, you’re helping decrease the prevalence of these pollutants and
            contributing to an overall healthier atmosphere.</p>
            <li class="e">Renewables lower reliance on foreign energy sources</li> <br>
           <p>With renewable energy technologies, you can produce energy locally. The more renewable energy you’re using for your
        power needs, the less you’ll rely on imported energy, and the more you’ll contribute to U.S. energy independence as a
        whole.</p>

        <h3>DISADVANTAGES</h3>
        <ol class="od">
            <li class="f">Higher upfront cost</li> <br>
            <p>While you can save money by using renewable energy, the technologies are typically more expensive upfront than
            traditional energy generators. To combat this, there are often financial incentives, such as tax credits and rebates,
            available to help alleviate your initial costs of renewable technology.</p>
            <li class="g">Intermittency</li> <br>
            <p>Though renewable energy resources are available around the world, many of these resources aren’t available 24/7,
            year-round. Some days may be windier than others, the sun doesn’t shine at night, and droughts may occur for periods of
            time. There can be unpredictable weather events that disrupt these technologies. Fossil fuels are not intermittent and
            can be turned on or off at any given time.</p>
            <li class="h">Storage capabilities</li> <br>
            <p>Because of the intermittency of some renewable energy sources, there’s a high need for energy storage. While there are
            storage technologies available today, they can be expensive, especially for large-scale renewable energy plants. It’s
            worth noting that energy storage capacity is growing as the technology progresses, and batteries are becoming more
            affordable as time goes on.</p>
            <li class="i">Geographic limitations</li> <br>
            <p>The United States has a diverse geography with varying climates, topographies, vegetation, and more. This creates a
            beautiful melting pot of landscapes but also means that there are some geographies that are more suitable for renewable
            technologies than others. For example, a large farm with open space may be a great place for a residential wind turbine
            or a solar energy system, while a townhome in a city covered in shade from taller buildings wouldn’t be able to reap the
            benefits of either technology on their property. If your property isn’t suitable for a personal renewable energy
            technology, there are other options. If you’re interested in solar but don’t have a sunny property, you can often still
            benefit from renewable energy by purchasing green power or enrolling in a community solar option.</p>

    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2> <br>
    <p>The conventional energy resources like oil, gas, and coal are very important for the improvement in economics of a
    country. A country like Pakistan is fully dependent on the conventional energy sources in spite of knowing its bad
    effects for health and environment like greenhouse effect, global warming effect, etc. Pakistan is blessed with all the
    renewable energy sources like hydro, wind, and geothermal, and for solar power generation also, it is a suitable
    country. But, the main problems to generate power from renewable energy resources are funds and politics. All the
    factors like emission of greenhouse gases, availability of resources, land requirements, water consumption, social
    impacts, and price of power generated are taken into consideration for the classification of renewable energy sources.
    Wind power generation is considered as lowest water consumption, lowest relative greenhouse gas emission, and most
    favorable social impacts. It is considered as one of the most sustainable renewable energy sources, followed by
    hydropower, photovoltaic, and then geothermal. Biomass is considered suitable for the small-scale industries because of
    saving of fuel in considerable amount. Local employment, better health, job opportunities, job creation, consumer
    choice, improvement of life standard, social bonds creation, income development, demographic impacts, social bonds
    creation, and community development can be achieved by the proper usage of renewable energy system. Along with benefits
    of renewable energy resources, these are complex to install and are local environmental and conditions sensitive. Their
    forecasting, execution, and planning require more consideration and knowledge as compared to other projects.</p>
