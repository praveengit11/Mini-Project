      <h1 id="head">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
      <p>

      </p>

    <p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are
    programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied
    to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and
    problem-solving.<br>
    The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that
    have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine
    learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from
    and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this
    automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text,
    images, or video.</b></p>

        <p>

        </p>
        <div class="im1">

        </p>
        <p>As the planet continues to warm, climate change impacts are worsening. In 2016, there were 772 weather and disaster
        events, triple the number that occurred in 1980. Twenty percent of species currently face extinction, and that number
        could rise to 50 percent by 2100. And even if all countries keep their Paris climate pledges, by 2100, it’s likely that
        average global temperatures will be 3˚C higher than in pre-industrial times.</p>
<br>
        <p>But we have a new tool to help us better manage the impacts of climate change and protect the planet: artificial
        intelligence (AI). AI refers to computer systems that “can sense their environment, think, learn, and act in response to
        what they sense and their programmed objectives,” according to a World Economic Forum report, Harnessing Artificial
        Intelligence for the Earth.</p> <br>
        <p>In India, AI has helped farmers get 30 percent higher groundnut yields per hectare by providing information on preparing
        the land, applying fertilizer and choosing sowing dates. In Norway, AI helped create a flexible and autonomous electric
        grid, integrating more renewable energy.</p> <br>
        <p>And AI has helped researchers achieve 89 to 99 percent accuracy in identifying tropical cyclones, weather fronts and
        atmospheric rivers, the latter of which can cause heavy precipitation and are often hard for humans to identify on their
        own. By improving weather forecasts, these types of programs can help keep people safe.</p> <br>

    <div class="technical">
        <h2>2. TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS</h2>
       <br>
       <ul>
           <li><b>ACCESS TO DATA</b></li> <br>
           <p>For prediction or decision models to be trained properly, they need data. As many people have put it, data is now one of
        the most sought-after commodities ousting oil. It has become a new currency. Currently, large troves of data sit in the
        hands of large corporate organizations. <br> These companies have an inherent advantage making it unfair to the little startups who have just entered the AI
        development race. If nothing is done about this, it would further drive a wedge in the power dynamic between big yech
        and startups.</p> <br>
        <li><b>BIAS</b></li> <br>
        <p>The ways biases can creep into data-modeling processes (which fuel AI) is quite frightening, not to mention the
        underlying (identified or unidentified) prejudices of the creators to factor in. Biased AI is much more nuanced than
        just tainted data. There are many stages of the deep-learning process that bias can slip through and currently, our
        standard design procedures simply aren't aptly equipped to identify them. <br> As <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/02/04/137602/this-is-how-ai-bias-really-happensand-why-its-so-hard-to-fix/?ref=hackernoon.com">this MIT Technology Review</a> article points out, our current method of even designing AI algorithms aren't really meant
        to identify and retroactively remove biases. Since most of these algorithms are tested only for their performance, a lot
        of unintended fluff flows through. This could be in the form of prejudiced data, a lack of social context and a
        debatable definition of fairness.</p> <br>
        <li><b>COMPUTING TIME</b></li> <br>
        <p>Even though technological advancements have been rapidly extending in recent years, there are still some hardware
        limitations like limited computation resources (for RAM and GPU cycles) that we have to overcome. Here again,
        established companies have a significant advantage, given the costs that arise from developing such custom and precise
        hardware.</p> <br>
        <li><b>COST</b></li> <br>
        <p>Mining, storing and analyzing data will be very costly both in terms of energy and hardware use. <br> The estimated training cost for the GPT-3 model was $4.6 million. Another video (see below) predicted that for a model
        similar to the brain, the training costs would be substantially higher than GPT-3, coming in at around $2.6 billion. <br> Also, given that skilled engineers in these fields are currently a rare commodity, hiring them will definitely dent the
        pockets of these companies. Here too, putting newer and smaller companies at a disadvantage.</p> <br>
        <li><b>ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS</b></li> <br>
        <p>Since AI isn't human, it isn't exactly equipped to adapt to deviations in circumstances. For example, simply applying
        tape on the wrong side of the road can cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into the wrong lane and crash. A human
        might not even register or react to the tape. While in normal conditions the autonomous vehicle may be far safer, it is
        these outlier cases that we need to be worried about. <br> It is this inability to adapt that highlights a glaring security flaw that is yet to be effectively addressed. While
        sometimes 'fooling' these data models can be fun and harmless (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1sp4X57TL4&ref=hackernoon.com">misidentifying a toaster for a banana</a> ), in extreme
        cases (like defense purposes) it could put lives at risk.</p> <br>
        <li><b>NO CONSENSUS ON SAFETY, ETHICS, AND PRIVACY</b></li> <br>
        <p>There is still some work to be done in figuring out the limits to which we use AI. Current limitations highlight the
        importance of safety in AI and it must be acted upon swiftly. Additionally, most critics of AI argue along lines of the
        ethics of implementing it, not just in terms of how it makes privacy a forgotten concept, but also philosophically. <br> We consider our intelligence inherently human and unique. Giving away that exclusivity can seem conflicting. One of the
        popular questions that arises is that if robots can do exactly whatever humans can and in essence become equal to
        humans, do they deserve human rights? If so, how far do you go in defining these robot's rights? There are no definite
        answers here. Given the recency of AI development, the field of philosophy of AI is still in its nascent stages. I am
        very excited to see how this sphere of AI develops.</p>

        <h2>3. SOCIAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li class="a">Making cities more livable and sustainable</li>
            <p>

            </p>
            <div class="iml1">
            <img src="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Beijing_Air_Pollution..._12691254574-303x202.jpg" alt="">
          </div>
            <p>

             </p>
            <p>AI can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the Internet of
            Things (the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data)
            to forecast energy demand. In addition, artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws, building
            ordinances, and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness. One vision for a sustainable city is
            to create an “urban dashboard” consisting of real-time data on energy and water use and availability, traffic and
            weather to make cities more energy efficient and livable.</p> <br>
            <li class="b">Smart agriculture</li>
            <p>

            </p>
            <div class="iml2">
            <img src="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Agric-Sensors-303x227.jpg" alt="">
          </div>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Hotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well. <br>
            Data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture, soil composition and temperature help AI improve production
            and know when crops need watering. Incorporating this information with that from drones, which are also used to monitor
            conditions, can help increasingly automatic AI systems know the best times to plant, spray and harvest crops, and when
            to head off diseases and other problems. This will result in increased efficiency, enhanced yields, and lower use of
            water, fertilizer and pesticides.</p> <br>
            <li class="c">Protecting the oceans</li>
            <p>

            </p>
            <div class="iml2">
            <img src="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ILlegal-fishing-303x216.jpg" alt="">
          </div>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>The Ocean Data Alliance is working with machine learning to provide data from satellites and ocean exploration so that
            decision-makers can monitor shipping, ocean mining, fishing, coral bleaching or the outbreak of a marine disease. With
            almost real time data, decision-makers and authorities will be able to respond to problems more quickly. Artificial
            intelligence can also help predict the spread of invasive species, follow marine litter, monitor ocean currents, keep
            track of dead zones and measure pollution levels.</p> <br>
            <li class="d">More sustainable transport on land</li>
            <p>As vehicles become able to communicate with each other and with the infrastructure, artificial intelligence will help
            drivers avoid hazards and traffic jams. In Pittsburgh, an artificial intelligence system incorporating sensors and
            cameras that monitors traffic flow adjusts traffic lights when needed. The systems are functioning at 50 intersections
            with plans for 150 more, and have already reduced travel time by 25 percent and idling by more than 40 percent. Less
            idling, of course, means fewer greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <br>

            <li class="e">Better climate predictions</li>
            <p>

            </p>
            <div class="iml1">
            <img src="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Global_Warming_Predictions-303x216.png" alt="">
          </div>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>As the climate changes, accurate projections are increasingly important. However, climate models often produce very
            different predictions, largely because of how data is broken down into discrete parts, how processes and systems are
            paired, and because of the large variety of spatial and temporal scales. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
            (IPCC) reports are based on many climate models and show the range of predictions, which are then averaged out. <br>
        AI and deep learning are also improving weather forecasting and the prediction of extreme events. That’s because they
        can incorporate much more of the real-world complexity of the climate system, such as atmospheric and ocean dynamics and
        ocean and atmospheric chemistry, into their calculations. This sharpens the precision of weather and climate modeling,
        making simulations more useful for decision-makers.</p> <br>
        <li class="f">AI has many other uses</li>
        <p>AI can help to monitor ecosystems and wildlife and their interactions. Its fast processing speeds can offer almost
        real-time satellite data to track illegal logging in forests. AI can monitor drinking water quality, manage residential
        water use, detect underground leaks in drinking water supply systems, and predict when water plants need maintenance. It
        can also simulate weather events and natural disasters to find vulnerabilities in disaster planning, determine which
        strategies for disaster response are most effective, and provide real-time disaster response coordination.</p> <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>DISADVANTAGES</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li class="g">Performance</li> <br>
            <p>The black box conclusions of AI may not be understandable to humans and thus it may be impossible to determine if they
            are accurate or desirable. Deep learning could be risky for applications such as early warning systems for natural
            disasters where more certainty is needed.</p> <br>
            <li class="h">Security</li> <br>
            <p>AI could potentially be hacked, enabling bad actors to interfere with energy, transportation, early warning or other
            crucial systems.</p>
            <li class="i">Control risks</li> <br>
            <p>Since AI systems interact autonomously, they can produce unpredictable outcomes. For example, two systems came up with a
            language of their own that humans couldn’t understand.</p> <br>
            <li class="j">Economic risks</li> <br>
            <p>Companies that are slower to adopt AI may suffer economic consequences as their AI-based competition advances. We are
            already seeing how brick and mortar stores are closing as the economy becomes increasingly digitized.</p>
            <li class="k">Social risk</li> <br>
            <p>AI is resulting in more automation, which will eliminate jobs in almost every field. Autonomous weapon systems could
            also hasten and exacerbate global conflicts.</p> <br>
            <li class="l">Ethical risks</li> <br>
            <p>Since AI uses inferred assumptions about groups and communities in making decisions, it could lead to increased bias.
            The collection of data also raises privacy issues.</p> <br>
            <p>To deal with these risks, the World Economic Forum states that government and industry “must ensure the safety,
            explainability, transparency and validity of AI application.” More interaction among public and private entities,
            technologists, policy-makers and even philosophers, and more investments in research are needed to avert the potential
            risks of artificial intelligence—and to realize its potential benefits to the environment and humanity.</p>
